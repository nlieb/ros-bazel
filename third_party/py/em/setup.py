DESCRIPTION = "A templating system for Python."

LONG_DESCRIPTION = """\
    EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements
    in template text; it takes an EmPy source file, processes it, and
    produces output.  This is accomplished via expansions, which are
    special signals to the EmPy system and are set off by a special
    prefix (by default the at sign, '@').  EmPy can expand arbitrary
    Python expressions and statements in this way, as well as a
    variety of special forms.  Textual data not explicitly delimited
    in this way is sent unaffected to the output, allowing Python to
    be used in effect as a markup language.  Also supported are "hook"
    callbacks, recording and playback via diversions, and dynamic,
    chainable filters.  The system is highly configurable via command
    line options and embedded commands.
